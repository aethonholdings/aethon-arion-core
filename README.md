# aethon-arion-core

## Description

This package defines the core classes required in an Arion simulation, as specified on the project's [homepage](https://arion.aethon.sg/our-tools/aethon-arion-core/).  The classes implement the modelling and mathematical objects described on the Arion [framework pages](https://arion.aethon.sg/our-framework/).

In order to work with the Arion data pipeline spanning the simulation node, server and analysis client, all Arion organisation models must be based on this package and implement the required abstract methods of the Board, Organisation, Plant, Reporting State and Simulation classes.
